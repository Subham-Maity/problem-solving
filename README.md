        float e = sc.nextFloat();
        float total = a+b+c+d+e;
        System.out.println("Total marks: " + total);
        System.out.println("Percentage of your 5 Subject is: ");
        float Percentage = (total/max)*100;
        System.out.println("Marks Percentage= "+ Percentage);
    }
}

```


### Python :

```python
maximum_numbers = int(input("Enter The Maximum Marks of One Subject (example: Physics 100) : "))
 
physics = int(input("Enter the number of your Subject 1 (Physics) : "))
 
math = int(input("Enter the number of your Subject 2 (Math) : "))
 
biology = int(input("Enter the number of your Subject 3 (Biology) : "))
 
chemistry = int(input("Enter the number of your Subject 4 (Chemistry) : "))
 
optional = int(input("Enter the number of your Subject 5 (Optional) : "))
 
 
total_marks = physics + math + biology + chemistry + optional
max_possible_marks = (maximum_numbers*5)
 
print("Total marks : ", total_marks)
print("Percentage of your 5 Subject is: ", (total_marks/max_possible_marks)*100)
 

```
# 2.Sum of three numbers :

```
# 6. Detects whether a number entered by the user is an integer or not.


## Exercise

Write a  program to detect whether a string by the user is an integer(number) return true or if not return false.

## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
For java : The hasNext() is a method of Java Scanner class which returns true if this scanner has another token in its input.
So here sc.hasNextInt()method returns true if the next set of characters in the input stream can be read in as an int. 
If they can't be read as an int, or they are too big for an int or if the end of the file has been reached, then it returns false. 
hasNextInt() itself does not consume any characters.
 
For Python : Python String isnumeric() method is a built-in method used for string handling. 
The isnumeric() method returns “True” if all characters in the string are numeric characters, Otherwise, It returns “False”
 
 

```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Enter your number");
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println(sc.hasNextInt());
    }
}


```


### Python :

```python
user_input = input("Enter your number ")
 
print(user_input.isnumeric())
 

 

```
# 7. Multiplication table, from any number to any number

## Exercise

printing multiplication table for any number, from any number to any number (all given in input) (Forward and reverse order multiplication should be implemented in the program)

## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
 
Forward : Run a incrementing for loop from Start to end and print the value of the given number what you want 
to get a multiplication table (note: Start < End ) 
Reverse : Run a decrementing for loop from Start to end and print the value of the given number what you want 
to get a multiplication table
(note: Start > End ) 
```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print(" Enter the number you want to get a multiplication table of : ");
        int n=s.nextInt();
        System.out.print("From where : ");
        int start=s.nextInt();
        System.out.print("To where : ");
        int end=s.nextInt();
 
        if (start <= end )
        for(int i=start; i <= end; i++)
        {
            System.out.println(n+" * "+i+" = "+n*i);
        }
        else{
            for(int i=start; i >=  end; i--){
                System.out.println(n+" * "+i+" = "+n*i);
            }
 
        }
    }
}


```


### Python :

```python

 value = int(input("Enter the number you want to get a multiplication table of : "))
start = int(input("From where : "))
end = int(input("To where : "))
 
 
if start <= end:
    for i in range(start, end+1):
        print(f"{value} * {i} = {value * i}")
elif start > end:
    for o in range(start, end-1, -1):
        print(f"{value} * {o} = {value * o}")


```
# 8. (Type Casting) Encrypt a grade by adding a number to it. Decrypt it to show the correct grade.

## Exercise
Write a program to the first user input his/her exam grade. Now the program asks for a code number to encrypt your grade by adding the number with your grade. Now the program asks you if you want to decrypt your grade press y or if no type n (note: Y/y or N/n case must be ignored and user can type the capital letter or small letter your program should understand)and if yes program will start decrypting your grade and show you your original grade otherwise program will print “ sorry sir/mam, we can't crack your grade “


## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Java: 1. First take a input as a char (letter like : A B C D ) 
      2. Take a input as an integer value 
      3. Type cast them because if we do any operation between char and int, it returns int (it’s called numaric Promotion Rules 
1.Byte + Short = Int  
2.Short + Int  = Int
3.Long + Float = Float
4.Character + Int = Int (here we use this)
5.Character + Short = Int
6.Long + Double = Double
7.Float + Double = Double)So we must have to cast them into char 
      4.Take a input as a string value (yes for y No for n) 
      6.we check the input letter(y/n) and also ignore case by equalsIgnoreCase 
      7.Type cast again and do this : Your given grade - Your given number 
 
==========================================================================
 
Python : To install “Click” package simply go to any terminal and type “pip install click”
 
1. We used 'Click' module by this command "import click"
2. Take a input as a string for your grade
3. Take a input as an string for your code
4. use 'click' for take yes or no on input
       
Python click module is used to create command-line (CLI) applications.
It is an easy-to-use alternative to the standard optparse and argparse modules.
 

```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println(" Enter Your Exam Grade ");
        char grade = sc.next().charAt(0);
        System.out.println("Enter Your Code Number We Will Encrypt Your Grade ");
        int a = sc.nextInt();

        // Encrypting the grade
        grade = (char)(grade + a);
        System.out.println("So Now Your Grade is : " + grade);

        // Ask User
        System.out.println("Sir/Mam, Do you want to decrypt your grade? If yes type " + " y/Y " + " If no type " + " n/N ") ;
        String answer = sc.next();

        // Decrypting the grade
        if ( (answer.equalsIgnoreCase("Y") ) ) {
            grade = (char) (grade - a);
            System.out.println("Your actual Grade is " + grade);
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("sorry Sir/mam, we can't crack your grade");
        }

    }
}


```


### Python :

```python

 import click
 
result = input("Please Enter Your Exam Grade: ")
code = input("Please Enter Your Encryption Code: ")
 
print("\nNow Your Grade is 'F'")
 
if click.confirm("\nSir/Ma'am, Do You Want to Decrypt Your Grade ? If Yes type 'Y/y' or 'N/n' for No :\n>> ",
                 default=True):
    print("Your Actual Grade is ", result)
else:
    print("Grade Decryption Aborted")

```
# 9.Comparison operators to find out whether a given number is greater than the user entered number or not.


## Exercise
Use comparison operators to find out whether a given number 28/56 is greater than the user entered number or not.



## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
 
Take a number from the user and compare them using < / > and store it in the boolean data type because 
if you compare two operators it returns true or false

```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
 
        Scanner ab = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a1 = 28;
        System.out.println("Given number is " + a1);
 
        System.out.println("Enter number = ");
 
        int a = ab.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a);
        boolean bool = (a1 >= a);
        if (bool){
            System.out.println("given number 28 is greater than your entered number ");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("given number 28 is less than your entered number ");
        }
    }
}


```


### Python :

```python
given_number = 56
print("The given number is", given_number)
 
user_input = int(input("Enter your number : \n"))
 
if user_input < given_number:
    print("Given number is greater than the entered number")
elif user_input == given_number:
    print("Both are same number")
else:
    print("Given number", given_number, "is less than the entered number")
 

```

        </p>




## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this for result we need to define the floating point
7/4 it always return an integer so 7/4 = 1 
                                Then 9/2 = 4
                                Then 1*4 = 4 (this is the reason why then 
 Our program return 4 instead of 7.875) 
```

# 12. Convert a string to lowercase.


## Exercise
Write a program to convert a string to lowercase. This string is given by the user.



## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Java : in java The toLowerCase() method converts a string to lower case letters
Python : in Python, the “ .lower” method is used to convert a string in lower case !
```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter any sentence or word: ");
        String string = sc.nextLine();
        string = string.toLowerCase();
        System.out.println("In lower case this word or sentence looks like this : " + "\n" + string);
    }
}


```


### Python :

```python
given_str = input("Enter any sentence or word : ")
 
print("In lower case this word or sentence looks like this :", given_str.lower())

 

```
# 13. Replace spaces with underscores.

## Exercise

Write a program to replace spaces with underscores. This string is given by the user.

## Approach:
```javascript

So here we did like this
Java : The replace() method searches a string for a specified character, and
returns a new string where the specified character(s) are replaced.
Python : It's the same as Java, just use the .replace method.
```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter any sentence with space: ");
        String string = sc.nextLine();
        string = string.replace(" ", "_");
        System.out.println("This sentence with underscores looks like this : " + "\n" + string);}}


```


### Python :

```python
txt = input("Enter your sentence with space : \n")
 
x = txt.replace(" ", "_")
 
print("This sentence with underscores looks like this:\n",x)


 

```
# 14. Fill in a letter template which looks like below:

## Exercise
Write a program to fill in a letter template which looks like below:
```javascript
Sentence =      “Dear <|name|>, Thanks a lot” 
 
Replace =      <|name|> with a string (some name)

```

## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Java : We use replace method but if we just do like this 
        String sentences = sc.nextLine();
        String sentence = "Dear <|name|>, Thanks a lot!";
        sentence.replace("<|name|>", sentences);
        System.out.println(sentence);
 It will execute this : Enter your name: Subham
                        Dear <|name|>, Thanks a lot!
If we want to change a string we need convert a string by storing it in 
another string variable
 
Python : We will use the .replace() method again and unlike java , we don’t need to store the string in another variable !


```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String sentences = sc.nextLine();
        String sentence = "Dear <|name|>, Thanks a lot!";
        sentence =  sentence.replace("<|name|>", sentences);
        System.out.println(sentence);
    }
}



```


### Python :

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
 
output = "Dear <|Name|>, Thanks a Lot !"
 
print(output.replace('<|Name|>', name))
```

# 15. Detects double and triple spaces in a string.

## Exercise
Write a  program to detect the index of double and triple spaces in a string given by the user.

        <img src="https://github.com/Subham-Maity/java-python-problem-solving-series/blob/master/Image(ignore)/15.png?raw=true"/>
        </p>

## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Java: The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence 
of specified character(s) in a string
 
Python : The .index() method return the position of first occurrence 
of specified character(s) in a string

```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.*;
public class code_xam {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter your Sentence ");

        System.out.println(str1.indexOf("  "));
        System.out.println(str1.indexOf("   "));
    }
}



```


### Python :

```python
txt = input("Enter Your sentence with 2 and 3 spaces:\n")
print(txt.index("  "))
print(txt.index("   "))

```
# 16. Check if a String contains only whitespaces

## Exercise
Check if a String given by the user contains only whitespaces or not if the string has only whitespace print
“ It is only whitespace” if not print “It’s a sentence ”

## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Java:
 
The Java String class trim() method eliminates leading and trailing spaces
he Java String class isEmpty() method checks if the input string is empty or not
 
Get the String to be checked in str1
We can use the trim() method of String class to remove the leading whitespaces in the string.
Syntax:
str1.trim()
Then we can use the isEmpty() method of String class to check if the resultant string is empty or not. If the string contained only whitespaces, then this method will return true
Syntax:
str.isEmpty()
Combine the use of both methods using Method Chaining.
str.trim().isEmpty()
Print true if the above condition is true. Else print false.
 
Python : We’re simply using if, else conditions here ! 


```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.*;
class CodeXam {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter your Sentence");
        String str1 = sc.nextLine();
        {
            if (str1.trim().isEmpty())
                System.out.println("It is only whitespace");
            else
                System.out.println("It's a sentence");
        }}}



```


### Python :

```python
input_str = input("Please enter your sentence : \n")
 
if  input_str:
    print("It's a sentence")
else:
    print("It's only Whitespace")

```

Press 3 : * (Multiplication) a * b 
Press 4 : / (Division) a / b 
Press 5 : % (Modulo or remainder) a % b 
Calculate the result according to the operation given and display it to the user

```

## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Java : using case switch and take the integer input from the user and operation to them as 
the instructions are given in the question 
 
Python : We take all int value as input and simply use if elif method


```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.*;

# 19.Print the name of the month.


## Exercise
Ask the user to enter the number of the month & print the name of the month. For eg - For ‘1’ print ‘January’, ‘2’ print ‘February’ & so on


## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Java : using case switch and take the integer input from the user and print according to the number
Python:Same as Java, we’re using Case switch method here, “match-case”.Python 3.10 (2021) introduced the
match-case statement which provides a first-class implementation of a "switch" for Python.

```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.*;

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
 
        System.out.println("Enter the number of the month \n(Press : 1 -12 only) " );
 
        int operator = sc.nextInt();
        String sentence = "The name of the month according to your number is: ";
 
        switch(operator) {

# 20.Prime or not (input from the user)


## Exercise
Print if a number is prime or not (Input n from the user). (without creating a method or recursion using if else and for loop or do while loop only)


## Approach:
```javascript
 Note : To find if a number is prime, why is checking till n/2 ?
            
Well, whenever you find a number which is Prime or not , you check it till n/2. That is true, and there is no problem checking it till n. But we don’t check it because there is no possibility of getting a number x which is divisible by n and which lies on the second half of the number (n/2).
 
Let’s check what I am talking about.
 
Consider the number 17. Check whether it is prime or not.
 
17%2≠0 (%=Modulus or Remainder)
 
17%3≠0
 
17%4≠0
 
17%5≠0
 
17%6≠0
 
17%7≠0
 
17%8≠0
 
17%9≠0 (Consider this which lies on the second half in the n/2).
 
You won’t find any more numbers which can produce the result.
 
The minimum number that can be divided by 17 is 2, and if you divide 17/9 which can’t give you the number which is less than 2. (We don’t consider 1 as minimum since 1 is divisible with every other number).
 
So, it is a waste of time to check further for any other number, or it is an inefficient algorithm in terms of computer programming.
 
 
 
Python : 
1st approach = Just same as Java approach mentioned above
 
2nd Approach = In python we can simply use pip(package manager)  to install a python package which is called “sympy” , just go to your terminal(for windows CMD or Powershell or Windows Terminal for Win 11, system terminal for MaxOS and any Linux Based OS) and type “pip install sympy”, it will automatically download and install sympy. After that, type “from sympy import *” on your IDE (see the 1st line of the python solution mentioned below). Then we can use the isprime() method which we imported from sympy !
 
P.S. To uninstall any kinda pip package just type “pip uninstall package_name”

# 23.Leap year or not.

## Exercise
Write a program to find whether a year entered by the user is a leap year or not.



## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Check if the year is divisible by 400 or 4 but not 100, DISPLAY "is a leap year",
Otherwise, DISPLAY ": is not a leap year.""

```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int year = sc.nextInt();
        if ((year % 400 == 0) || ((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0))) {
            System.out.println(year + " : is a leap year");
        }
        else {System.out.println(year + " : is not a leap year.");
        }
    }
}



```


### Python :

```python
year = int(input("Enter your Year:\n"))
 
leap_year = "It's a leap year !"
common_year = "It's not a leap year"
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 != 0:
        print(leap_year)
    elif year % 400 == 0:
        print(leap_year)
    else:
        print(common_year)
else:
    print(common_year)

# 24.Type of website

## Exercise
* Write a program to find out the type of website from the URL:

* .com – commercial website

* .org – organization website

* .in – Indian website


## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Java : The Java String class endsWith() method checks if this string ends with a given suffix. It returns true if this string ends with the given suffix; else returns false.
Python : Same like Java, we’re using endswith() method in python as well


```
## Solution

### Java :

```java

import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter Your Website: ");
        String website = sc.next();
        if(website.endsWith(".org")){
            System.out.println("This is an Organizational website");
        }
        else if(website.endsWith(".com")){
            System.out.println("This is a Commercial website");
        }
        else if(website.endsWith(".in")){
            System.out.println("This is an Indian website");
        }
        }
    }


```


### Python :

```python
user_input = input("Please Enter Your URL:\n")
 
if user_input.endswith(".com"):
    print("It's an Commercial Website")
elif user_input.endswith(".org"):
    print("It's an Organization Website")
elif user_input.endswith(".in"):
    print("It's an Indian Website")
else:

# 25.Email by deleting the part

## Exercise
Input an email from the user. You have to create a username from the email by deleting the part that comes after ‘@’. Display that username to the user.
Example :

email = “codexam@gmail.com” ; username = “codexam”

email = “helloWorld123@gmail.com”; username = “helloWorld123”


## Approach:
```javascript
Python: In python we're simply using slicing, 
we're printing from index 0 to (index of '@') -1

```

# 27. Rock, Paper Scissors game


## Exercise
Create a simple Rock, Paper Scissors game


## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Rules and Main approach:
 Rock wins against scissors
 paper wins against rock
 scissors wins against paper
 Here 0 = ROCK 1 = Paper 2 = Scissors, 
If
Case 1 When user enter 0 Rock(0) wins against scissors(2) so user_input == 0 && comp_input == 2 So user win here
Case 2 When user enter 1 paper(1) wins against rock(0) so user_input == 1 && comp_input == 0 So user win 
Case 3 When user enter 2 scissors(2) wins against paper(1) so user_input == 2 && comp_input == 1 So user win
Else Any other case(except case1/case2/case3) computer win 
 
 
 
 
In java :
I use switch case and first make scanner class and random method 
Step 1: For user (scanner class takes input as 0 1 2)
       
Step 2: For pc (scanner class takes input as 0 1 2) scanner class takes input from the random method(where bound is 3)
Step 3:I use while loop for 3 times game play
Step 4: Total 3 case for user and total 3 case for Pc
Step 5:Now I compare the cases between user and pc
For user win
Case 1 When user enter 0 Rock(0) wins against scissors(2) so user_input == 0 && comp_input == 2 So user win here
Case 2 When user enter 1 paper(1) wins against rock(0) so user_input == 1 && comp_input == 0 So user win 
Case 3 When user enter 2 scissors(2) wins against paper(1) so user_input == 2 && comp_input == 1 So user win
For pc win
Any other case(except case1/case2/case3) computer win 
Step 6:Now just print the counter for how many times user win

## Solution

### Java :

```java
//While loop
import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam{
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
 
       // Take number from user
       System.out.print("Enter any number : ");
       int num = sc.nextInt();
       System.out.println("\nNatural numbers from 1 to " + num);
       int i = 1; //initialization
       while (i <= num) { //condition check
           System.out.print(i + " ");// if true execute the statement this with update
           i++; // update
       }
   }
}
//Do-While loop
public class CodeXam{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Take number from user
        System.out.print("Enter any number : ");
        int num = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("\nNatural numbers from 1 to " + num);
        int i = 1; //initialization
        do {
            System.out.print(i + " ");// the statement

            i++; // update
        }
        while (i <= num) ;//condition check if condition is true execute the statement
    }
}




```


### Python :

```python

# While Loop
 
"""A while loop will run a piece of code while a condition is True. It will keep executing the desired
set of code statements until that condition is no longer True. A while loop will always first check the condition
before running"""
 
num = int(input("Please Enter Your Number: "))
n = 1
print(f"Natural Numbers from {n} to {num} is :")
while n <= num:
   print(n, end=" ")
   n += 1
 
 
 # Do While Loop
 
"""What is unique in Do While loops is the fact that the code in the loop block will be executed at least one time.The code in the statement runs one time and then the condition is checked only after the code is executed 
As Do While Loop doesn't really exist in python , so we're going to modify a simple while loop into a Do While Loop"""
 
 
num = int(input("\nPlease Enter Your Number: "))
n = 1
print(f"Natural Numbers from {n} to {num} is :")
while True:
   print(n, end=" ")
   n += 1
   if n > num:
       break


```

# 29. Break in For and Do While Loop 1

## Exercise
```javascript
Print " user entered name " 10 times but if user would like to break the loop then print his/her name at that number of times and print "You want to stop at " user’s enter number " so I stop "
*Do it in for loop and do while loop
Enter Your Name
Xam
In order to stop printing at any number of times before 10 times printing your name, you can enter yes then enter number otherwise type no for 10 times printing your name 
yes
Enter the number
6
Xam
Xam
Xam
Xam
Xam
Xam
You want to stop at 6 so I stop here


```

## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
In a Nutshell …break statement completely exits the loop
The break statement is used to exit the loop irrespective of whether the condition is true or false.
Whenever a ‘break’ is encountered inside the loop, the control is sent outside the loop.
Syntax :

# 30. Continue in For and Do While Loop 1


## Exercise
print "user entered name" 10 times but if the user wants to skip his name at any number of times and print " You skip your “user entered name” at "user entered number" “ and then continue looping and print the remaining user entered name
*Do it in for loop and do while loop
```javascript
Enter Your Name
Xam

yes
Enter the number
5
Xam
Xam
Xam
Xam
You skip Xam at 5
Xam
Xam
Xam

Xam

```

## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
In a Nutshell …continue statement skips the particular iteration of the loop.
The continue statement is used to immediately move to the next iteration of the loop.
The control is taken to the next iteration thus skipping everything below ‘continue’ inside the loop for that iteration.

# 35. Integer is present in an array or not


## Exercise
Write a program to find out whether the user given floating value is present in an array of 45.7, 67.8, 63.4, 99.2, 100.0 or not

## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Java: 
1.Making Array of 45.7f, 67.8f, 63.4f, 99.2f, 100.0f
2.Taking number from the user 
3.Default Boolean value as false store in isInArray 
4.For each loop is used to traverse the array 
5.While traversing if any element match with entered number 
returning true will store in isInArray.
6.if not then simple print The value is not present in the array
 
 


```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class CodeXam {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    float [] marks = {45.7f, 67.8f, 63.4f, 99.2f, 100.0f};
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter number");
    float num = sc.nextFloat();
    boolean isInArray = false;
    for(float element:marks){
      if(num==element){
        isInArray = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    if(isInArray){
      System.out.println("The value is present in the array");
    }
    else{
      System.out.println("The value is not present in the array");
    }
  }
}



```


### Python :

```python
# approach 1
n = float(input("Please enter your value : "))
arr = [45.7, 67.8, 63.4, 99.2, 100.0]
 
if n in arr:
   print(f"The Value is present in the array at the index {arr.index(n)}")
else:
   print("The value isn't present in the array")
 
 
# approach 2
n = float(input("Please enter your value : "))
arr = [45.7, 67.8, 63.4, 99.2, 100.0]
in_arr = False
for i in arr:
   if i == n:
       in_arr = True
       break
 
if in_arr:
   print(f"The Value is present in the array at the index {arr.index(n)}")
else:
   print("The value isn't present in the array")
 

```

# 36. Averages from an array

## Exercise
Calculate the average marks from an array containing marks(45.7, 67.8, 63.4, 99.2, 100.0 )  of all students in physics using a for-each loop in java and normal for loop in python.


## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
Sum = 0 default 
Sum = sum + element (45.7f, 67.8f, 63.4f, 99.2f, 100.0f)
Sum / marks.length (n size means here 5) 


```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
public class CodeXam {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    {
      float[] marks = {45.7f, 67.8f, 63.4f, 99.2f, 100.0f};
      float sum = 0;
      for (float element : marks) {//for each loop
        sum = sum + element;
      }
      System.out.println("The value of average marks is " + sum / marks.length);
    }
  }
}



```


### Python :

```python
arr = [45.7, 67.8, 63.4, 99.2, 100.0]
total_sum = 0
for i in arr:
   total_sum += i
print(f"The average value of sum in the array {arr} is {total_sum/len(arr)}")

## Approach:
```javascript
So here we did like this
 
java:
1.Three multidimensional Arrays create mat1 ,mat2 , mat3  
         
 Mat1 = 5 10 20 (row1)   
        8 6 5 (row2) 
 Mat2 = 3 8 5(row1) 
        2 9 3 (row2) 
 Mat3 = Result Default zero so , 0 0 0(row1) 
                                 0 0 0(row2) 
 
 
 
2.first loop run for setting the value of i and j [matrix format] for result
Like this
 
 
 First loop for row (0-mat1.length)(2 arrays so 0 to 1)
 
 Second Loop for column (0-mat1[i].length)(here mat1[i] is first 5 10 20 means 3 element so run this loops for 0-2)  
```

      for (int i = 0; i < mat1.length; i++) { // row number of times
        for (int j = 0; j < mat1[i].length; j++) { // column number of time
          System.out.format(" Setting value for i=%d and j=%d\n", i, j);

## Approach:
## Ref GFG Video [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEZoUVOqOs8&ab_channel=GeeksforGeeks) (Recommend : 1.5x video Speed)
```javascript
APPROACH : 
Algorithm: (We are given a 2D matrix of rows X cols ).

1. We will need 4 variables:
-------------------------------
a. row_start - initialized with 0.
b. row_end - initialized with n-1.
c. column_start - initialized with 0.
d. column_end - initialized with m-1.



2. First of all, we will traverse in the row row_start from column_start
to column_end and we will increase the row_start with 1 as we have
traversed the starting row.


3. Then we will traverse in the column column_end from row_start to
row_end and decrease the column_end by 1.


4. Then we will traverse in the row row_end from column_end to
column_start and decrease the row_end by 1.


5. Then we will traverse in the column column_start from row_end to
row_start and increase the column_start by 1.


6. We will do the above steps from 2 to 5 until row_start <= row_end
and column_start <= column_end.


```

# 49. Set Matrix Zeroes 


## Exercise

### leetcode Solve [Here](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)

Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix.

<p align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/Subham-Maity/problem-solving/blob/master/Image(ignore)/73.png?raw=true"/>
        </p>

```javascript
Examples 1:

Input: matrix=[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]

Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

Explanation: Since matrix[2][2]=0.Therfore the 2nd column and 2nd row wil be set to 0.
 
Input: matrix=[[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]

Output:[[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]

Explanation:Since matrix[0][0]=0 and matrix[0][3]=0. Therefore 1st row, 1st column and 4th column will be set to 0

```

### Solution Video [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgaOU5aInOc&t=499s&ab_channel=Pepcoding)

## Approach 1:(Using brute force)
```javascript


Assuming all the elements in the matrix are non-negative. 
Traverse through the matrix and if you find an element with value 0, 
then change all the elements in its row and column to -1, except when an element is 0.
The reason for not changing other elements to 0, but -1, 
is because that might affect other columns and rows. 
Now traverse through the matrix again and if an element
is -1 change it to 0, which will be the answer.
```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.*;
class CodeXam {
    static void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {
        int rows = matrix.length, cols = matrix[0].length;
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {

                    int ind = i - 1;
                    while (ind >= 0) {
                        if (matrix[ind][j] != 0) {
                            matrix[ind][j] = -1;
                        }

                        ind--;
                    }
                    ind = j + 1;
                    while (ind < cols) {
                        if (matrix[i][ind] != 0) {
                            matrix[i][ind] = -1;

                        }
                        ind++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] <= 0) {
                    matrix[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }

    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[][] = {{0, 1, 2, 0}, {3, 4, 5, 2}, {1, 3, 1, 5}};
        setZeroes(arr);
        System.out.println("The Final Matrix is ");
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < arr[0].length; j++) {
                System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```
## Approach 2:(Better approach)
Intuition:
Instead of traversing through each row and column, we can use dummy arrays to check if the particular row or column has an element 0 or not, which will improve the time complexity.

```javascript
Intuition: Instead of traversing through each row and column,
 we can use dummy arrays to check if the particular row or column has 
 an element 0 or not, which will improve the time complexity.

Approach:Take two dummy array one of size of row and other of 
size of column.Now traverse through the array.
If matrix[i][j]==0 then set dummy1[i]=0(for row) and dummy2[j]=0(for column).
Now traverse through the array again and 
if dummy1[i]==0  || dummy2[j]==0 then arr[i][j]=0,else continue.
```
## Solution

### Java :

```java
import java.util.*;
class CodeXam{
  static void setZeroes(int [][] matrix) {
    int rows = matrix.length, cols = matrix[0].length;
    int dummy1[]=new int[rows];
    int dummy2[]=new int[cols];
    Arrays.fill(dummy1,-1);
    Arrays.fill(dummy2,-1);
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
          dummy1[i] = 0;
          dummy2[j] = 0;
        }
      }

    }
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        if (dummy1[i] == 0 || dummy2[j]==0) {
          matrix[i][j] = 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int arr[][] = {{0, 1, 2, 0}, {3, 4, 5, 2}, {1, 3, 1, 5}};
    setZeroes(arr);
    System.out.println("The Final Matrix is ");
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < arr[0].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ");
      }
      System.out.println();
    }
  }
}
```


## Approach 3:(Optimizing the better approach.)
Intuition:
Instead of taking two dummy arrays we can use the first row and column of the matrix for the same work. This will help to reduce the space complexity of the problem. While traversing for the second time the first row and column will be computed first, which will affect the values of further elements that’s why we traversing in the reverse direction.

```javascript
Instead of taking two separate dummy array,take first row and column
of the matrix as the array for checking whether the particular column 
or row has the value 0 or not.Since matrix[0][0] are overlapping.
Therefore take separate variable col0(say) to check if the 0th column 
has 0 or not and use matrix[0][0] to check if the 0th row has 0 or not.
Now traverse from last element to the first element and 
check if matrix[i][0]==0 || matrix[0][j]==0 and if true set matrix[i][j]=0,else continue.
```
## Solution

### Java : 

```java
import java.util.*;
class CodeXam{
  static void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {
    int col0 = 1, rows = matrix.length, cols = matrix[0].length;

    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
      if (matrix[i][0] == 0) col0 = 0;
      for (int j = 1; j < cols; j++)
        if (matrix[i][j] == 0)
          matrix[i][0] = matrix[0][j] = 0;
    }

    for (int i = rows - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      for (int j = cols - 1; j >= 1; j--)
        if (matrix[i][0] == 0 || matrix[0][j] == 0)
          matrix[i][j] = 0;
      if (col0 == 0) matrix[i][0] = 0;
    }
  }
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int arr[][] = {{0, 1, 2, 0}, {3, 4, 5, 2}, {1, 3, 1, 5}};
    setZeroes(arr);
    System.out.println("The Final Matrix is ");
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < arr[0].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ");
      }
      System.out.println();
    }
  }
}
